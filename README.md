# Fira Stationery
_Fira_ is a simple stationery I designed for my own use for both my outgoing email from Apple Mail as well as my Zendesk account. My goal was to incorporate various design concepts used by Apple, Google, and Mozilla to create a simple, clean, unobtrusive template that put the content in the spotlight rather than itself.

##### Please Note
As I only use basic HTML (via Zendesk) and Apple Mail for email, this stationery is provided in original HTML form as well as an Apple Mail Stationery package. If anyone is interested in contributing a version for Outlook, Thunderbird, or other email clients, you are welcome to do so.

## Installation
For **basic HTML**

Simply edit the message, salutation, and signature as you need.

For **Apple Mail**

Double-click `Fira.stationery`. Mail will open and confirm the installation of the package.

For **Outlook** & **Thunderbird**

I haven't touched Outlook since the 90s and I refuse to use it now. If you use Outlook and would like to contribute an Outlook stationery version to the project, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thunderbird, on the other hand, may get a version included for it in a future update, although I haven't set a timeframe. I always loved Thunderbird until I migrated to a predominantly Apple environment, so I'm sure I can give it the special treatment for old time's sake.
