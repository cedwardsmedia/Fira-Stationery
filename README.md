# Fira Stationery
Foo

### Hey! Read me!
As I only use pure HTML and Apple Mail for email, this stationery is provided in original HTML form as well as an Apple Mail Stationery package. If anyone is interested in contributing a version for Outlook, Thunderbird, or other email clients, you are welcome to do so.

## Installation
For pure HTML, simply edit the message, salutation, and signature as you need.

### Apple Mail
Double-click `Fira.stationery`. Mail will open and confirm the installation of the package.
