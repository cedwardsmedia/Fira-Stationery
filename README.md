_Fira Stationery_ is a simple stationery I designed for my own use for both my outgoing email from Apple Mail as well as my Zendesk account. My goal was to incorporate various design concepts used by Apple, Google, and Mozilla to create a simple, clean, unobtrusive template that put the content in the spotlight rather than itself.

## Installation
For **basic HTML**

Simply edit (or remove) the logo, message, salutation, and signature as you need.

Note: Logo is set as the background of `div.inner` on line 25

For **Apple Mail**

Double-click `Fira.stationery`. Mail will open and confirm the installation of the package.

For **Outlook** & **Thunderbird**

I haven't touched Outlook since the 90s and I refuse to use it now. If you use Outlook and would like to contribute an Outlook stationery version to the project, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thunderbird, on the other hand, may get a version included for it in a future update, although I haven't set a timeframe. I always loved Thunderbird until I migrated to a predominantly Apple environment, so I'm sure I can give it the special treatment for old time's sake.

For **other email clients**

As with Outlook, Thunderbird, and other aspects of this project, you are more than welcome to contribute a new version of this stationery for any other email client. I simply haven't done it because I only use Apple Mail and Zendesk.
